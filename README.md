# uc_disable_countries - Drupal 7 Ubercart

Gives site builders the ability to disable countries in the "Country" dropdown on the checkout page. Countries in the billing and shipping pane can be disabled separately (to allow someone to buy a product from a UK address without shipping there for example).

Tested with Ubercart 7.x-3.11 only

### Prerequisites
